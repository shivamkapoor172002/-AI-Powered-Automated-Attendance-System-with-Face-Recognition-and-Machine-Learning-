# AI-Powered-Automated-Attendance-System-with-Face-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-


This project is an attendance system that uses face recognition technology to identify and mark the attendance of individuals in a video. It can be used in educational institutions or organizations to automate the attendance process.

## Overview

The project performs the following tasks:

- Recognizes faces in a given video.
- Matches the detected faces with known faces from a training dataset.
- Marks attendance by recording the names, roll numbers, and classes of recognized individuals.
- Generates an attendance report in a CSV file.

## Installation

To run the project, you need to install the required dependencies. You can use the following commands to install them:


pip install opencv-python-headless
pip install cmake
